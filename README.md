## 3D Cell Segmentation Project

High-quality **3D cell segmentation** is a critical step in the quantitative analysis of dynamic cell behavior in living systems. While numerous tools exist for **2D cell segmentation**—such as **StarDist**, **Cellpose**, **CellProfiler**, and **Ilastik**, many of which allow user fine-tuning and semi-automated workflows—solutions for **3D segmentation** remain limited in both scope and adaptability.

This project aims to fill that gap by developing an **open and modular 3D cell segmentation pipeline**, leveraging the strengths of both **StarDist3D** and **Cellpose 3D**, customized for **multi-modal, multi-scale imaging datasets** generated by the [Center for Living Systems (CLS)](https://living-systems.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

### Data Sources

We are focusing on 3D fluorescence microscopy data from CLS-affiliated labs, including:
- **Stem cell colonies and gastruloids** (Gardel Lab)
- **Zebrafish embryos with fluorescent nuclei** (Jerison Lab)
- **C. elegans datasets** (Dinner Lab)
- **Gut organoids and epithelial structures** (Mitchell Lab)

These datasets are diverse in resolution, imaging modality (e.g., light-sheet, confocal), and biological structure, making them ideal for benchmarking and improving segmentation robustness.

### Project Goals

- Build a functional **prototype 3D segmentation pipeline** using open-source tools (StarDist3D, Cellpose 3D).
- Tailor model pre-processing and post-processing strategies to match specific CLS datasets.
- Establish annotation strategies and evaluation metrics for 3D segmentation performance.
- Provide a base for a future **3D Cell Segmentation Foundation Model**, which will use self-supervised pretraining (e.g., 3D MAE) to generalize across diverse imaging conditions and reduce reliance on manual annotation.

By advancing 3D segmentation methods on real-world, challenging biological datasets, this project serves both immediate research needs and long-term infrastructure goals. Our final aim is to develop a generalizable, scalable segmentation framework that can support **adaptive experimentation and AI-driven biological discovery** across CLS projects.
